vh measurement is viewport height.

Display flex style will stack the list to be appear in horizontal view.
Now if we do display flex it'll set our content on horizontal way but it'll not be arranged in a distant way by default.

Now in order to specify the content positon to set up either in left and right side, we'll use something called justify content :space-between; in the nav bar.
